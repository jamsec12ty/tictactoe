# **Project Zero - Tic Tac toe**

##This is a project I completed for General Assembly.

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

##The game can be accessed via the following link:

This version of tic tac toe is a simple version designed for 2 players using the same browser window.

##List of technologies used in this Project

##Description of the game

Player One is assigned the "X" token while Player Two is assigned the "O" token.

In the event a player successfully marks a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row, an alert will pop up indicating they won.

When the squares have been filled and neither player has succeeded in completing a row, the alert will indicate a draw.

The game does keep track of each player's score, and the score counter windows will be added in the next update.

An AI computer opponent is in development and will be released in later iterations.
